**Hello, I'm Jonas (aka Daenges).** o/

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the Ohm University of Applied Sciences in Nuremberg.  
In my free time, I enjoy working on various hobby projects, including:

- [This website](https://github.com/Daenges/daenges-profile) built with Hugo and Tailwind
- A BetterDiscord  [plugin](https://github.com/Daenges/DiscordWebTorrent) developed in React
- Minecraft server finder created with SvelteKit
- Contributions to the [Minecraft Console Client](https://github.com/MCCTeam/Minecraft-Console-Client) in C#
- A verification Discord bot written in Python
- A [Spotify exporter](https://github.com/Daenges/Spotify-Downloader-Bash) using Bash
- Several smaller projects in Go

I'm currently diving into [distributed systems](https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/books/ds4/) and I'm excited to begin a project in this field.   
If you have an interesting project idea or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out using the contact information provided.
